## Installation

One can access the project via this link: https://mysterious-beyond-10068.herokuapp.com/

## Usage 

A demo of the app can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UI6AZ9gAwBMlf0yeL2UdoTzwaCaUho-U/view 

This app serves as both a resource and social landing spot for people already professionally involved in real-estate or people with an interest in getting involved—from real-estate agents to first-time home buyers and renters. It creates a place where people of all walks of life can come together in a real-estate setting. The landing page of the app brings you to a login/create user page. After creating a profile and loggin in, the user has access to a "Share" page where they can make posts of their own and like and/or save posts made by other users. The Vision Board page provides a platform for building whatever the user desires—a place to dream up their dream home's interior or exterior design, for example. The user just favorites the posts they want to save and they are then added to the user's vision board page. On the "Plan" page, the user can make mortgage and savings calculations to help them plan and understand their finances. Finally, on the resource page, the user is provided with useful links and third-party resources to expand their research with sources that are reputable.
