## Usage 

This app serves as both a resource and social landing spot for people already professionally involved in real-estate or people with an interest in getting involved—from real-estate agents to first-time home buyers and renters. After creating a profile, the user has access to a place they can make posts of their own, like and/or save posts made by other users, make mortgage calculations, and find resources to expand their knowledge of all things surrounding real-estate. The Vision Board page provides a platform for building whatever the user desires— a place to dream up their dream home's interior or exterior design, a place to share listings, or a place to lay out a financial plan. This page serves to be a creative as well as informative place for anyone at any level of real-estate experience.
